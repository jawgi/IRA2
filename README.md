## **FreshPick RoboSort**

FreshPick RoboSort is an industrial robotics system created for the UTS subject Industrial Robotics 41013 to assist farmers, local produce markets and grocery stores sort their produce by colour and size in a safe and efficient manner. It utilises a Linear UR3e robot arm and the Igus ReBel robot arm to sort produce in those two stages.

## **Usage**

To use FreshPick RoboSort, follow these steps:

1. Open the project A2Scaffold.m in MATLAB.
2. Modify the source code to fit your needs - i.e. modify number of fruits to be picked/placed, the speed of operation with the variable defaultSteps and the maximum allowed error.
4. Ensure you have downloaded and installed Peter Corke's MATLAB Robotics Toolbox modified (by UTS) - v10.4 (20230804).7z
3. Run the project: **`A2Scaffold`**
5. Follow start prompts to start operation of the system.
